# tailwind-factory

Run npm install, duplicate the project inside 'projects' folder, rename it and in package.json duplicate & adjust the script with the proper names & paths.

In assets/css: the custom folder holds the custom css code, tailwind.css holds the tailwind import, and input.css compiles these two into styles.css

Atferwards, just use npm run watch:<command> to compile&watch the modifications in the html and css files.

Once finished, the folder with the project can be used independently anywhere else.
